  <p>&amp; Hello Professor. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Jack Jarjourah and I'm a fourth year Applied Cybersecurity major. 
    Not sure why I'm taking this course but I love programming and I think I'll have a lot of fun learning HTMl.
    I'm also super happy to be learning how to connect github repos with local repos!</p>
