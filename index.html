  <p>&amp; Hello Professor. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Jack Jarjourah and I'm a fourth year Applied Cybersecurity major.<br>
    Not sure why I'm taking this course but I love programming and I think I'll have a lot of fun learning HTML.<br>
    I'm also super happy to be learning how to connect GitHub repos with local repos, it sure will come in handy - I should have learned this myself so long ago!</p>
